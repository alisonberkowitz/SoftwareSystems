One of the goals of this homework is for you to practice orienting yourself to a new library by reading documentation and examples.  By "orienting" I mean the process of exploring and building a mental map of the landscape.  And by "landscape" I mean the set of features provided by the library, and the idioms the library provides.  And by "idioms" I mean the patterns, style, and practices associated with the library.
